      Ajuwe, You have shown me love from the very first moment I knew you as my brother, 
      as time passed on my errors and ill behaviour brought the distance between us 
      and your anger towards me.  I know I have used the  words I AM SORRY so much 
      that it has lost its value coming from me. I have not been able to approach you
       because I know what I did really hurt you and you might not listen to me. I really
        want you to know that everything I have ever done was out of immaturity and ignorance. 
         Deep down I have always loved you as my brother, I have never for a moment wished you
          bad no matter how ill I have behaved. I might not be able to win back the love you had for
           me but I hope and pray that you forgive me, if I don’t deserve your forgiveness please
            do it for my father’s sake. I am a totally different person from who I was when I made
             all the errors I have made before now. I promise you what ever errors I have made before
              now can never be repeated neither can I make similar erros because I am really a new human
               now. Please let what ever I have done to pass, please give me a new beginning. <br>From your son Oke Okorefe.
